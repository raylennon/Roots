# Roots
**Roots** is a game about giving; a dynamic, immersive experience insipired by The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein. 

Roots is created in Unity, and is therefore not well-suited to GitHub hosting. The Unity project is zipped and linked [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10rL8UgE_-3ouxu1kovFMN8porpMr4PwT/view?usp=sharing). You can find a youtube video showing the gameplay of Roots [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tgr-CIqN08&feature=emb_title)
